Falcao, Rebeca Cardim, and Daniel Coombs. "Diffusion analysis of single particle trajectories in a Bayesian nonparametrics framework." bioRxiv (2019): 704049.

Code to run: main.m

Below is an example of how to run the iHMMSPT model (main.m). \
First line of the code adds the directory of the sampler.\

```
addpath( [pwd '\sampler_SRC']) % adding path to sampler
```

Next, we need to load the data, If the data is not on the same directory as the code, we need to specify the path.

```
%% directories
dirIN=pwd; %pwd local directory
%% Data Load
fname='Displacements-4.mat';
load(fullfile(dirIN,fname));
```

The data should be a vector where each value is the displacement for that time frame. 
If we have a 2-D or 3-D displacements, we treat each dimension as a new chain, and concatanate all data in one vector.
For example, let x=[...], y=[...], and z=[...] be column vectors, then the final data should be a column vector a swell. In MATLAB code: xyz=[x; y; z]
Once the data is loaded, and processed, we need to add it to the sampler input (handles):

```
handles.x=DataX(:,1)'; %data
```

After, we set the experimental errors. If no experimental error (simulated data), set it to 0:

```
error=0;  %experimental error
```

Next, we need to specify the number of iterations and the percentage of steps that is from the burn-in phase. This percentage of steps we do not use on the estimation of parameters. Here, we define 5000 steps, where 15% is burn-in.

```
%% Iteration steps % Number of iterations and percentage of burn-in steps
r_total=5000; % total number of steps
per=0.15; % percentage of steps on burn-in phase
r_burnin=per*r_total;
r_max=(1-per)*r_total;
```

After, we set the hypermarameters of the model, the initial number of states, and the number of burn-ins.

```
%% Hyperparameters and other variables for the algorithm\
opts.K_init = 10; %initial number of states\
opts.a = 1; %hyperparameter alpha of the Dirichlet Process (transition probabilities concentration)\
opts.g = 0.05; %hyperparameter gamma of the stick breaking process (base concentration)\
opts.Q = [0,0,1,0.1]; %hyperparameter of emission distribution (conjugacy model: the first two is for mean, where we set to 0 for SPT.)-->[0,0,2*a,b/a)](a and b from eq.2)\
opts.dr_sk = 1;\
number_of_burnins=5; %implementation parameters\
%burn-in\
best_burnin=burnin_main(handles.x,r_burnin,error,opts,number_of_burnins);\
%after burn-in\
chain_final = chainer_main(handles.x, r_max, best_burnin, opts, true);\
%% Saving Results\
save('results-4.mat','chain_final');
```
